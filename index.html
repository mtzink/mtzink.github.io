            Welcome!</header>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I am a current graduate student studying Software Development. This website
            acts as my biography and eventually, a portfolio of my work. This page serves as both an introduction
            to myself and the website as a whole. Please feel free to choose from the other available topics from the list below.</p>
        <p>Before this program, my time was spent pursuing my undergraduate degrees. In 2022, I graduated with a BS in Computer Science,
            and a BA in Theatre from Pepperdine University. I achieved these degrees in 4 years, which required taking full course loads every semester including summers.
            Now, I dedicate my time to continue learning and creating projects both inside and outside of my Master's program.</p>
        <p>For this website, I wanted to make something reminiscent of GeoCities pages and older instances of windows. This is despite the fact that I was not browsing sites like these
            when I was young enough for them to be around. Despite this the visual language of websites like these are still so ingrained in my
            brain when I think about the "old internet" that's all that can come to my mind. So, instead of going for a more modern design, I thought it would 
            be fun to make my website with some of these older design qualities.
        </p>
